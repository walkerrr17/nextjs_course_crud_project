# Next.js CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Next.js I made during my Udemy Next.js course. The project demonstrates basic CRUD functionalities using **Firebase Firestore** as the database, **TailwindCSS** for styling, and **Next.js** as the main framework.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a foundational exercise to showcase how CRUD operations can be implemented in a Next.js application integrated with Firebase Firestore. It includes features such as creating new data, reading and displaying existing information, updating records, and deleting unwanted items.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: The main framework for building the application
- **Firebase Firestore**: For real-time database storage and retrieval
- **TailwindCSS**: For modern and responsive UI styling
